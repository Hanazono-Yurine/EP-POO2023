# EP-POO2023
This is the EP (Proposed Execution) of the subject of the Object Oriented Programming Laboratory at USP, in the year 2023.

## Proposal
The proposal was to make a program similar to Simulink, basically a program for simulating some electronic circuits

# How to use

First you have to clone this repo:

`git clone htttps://github.com/Hanazono-Yurine/EP-POO2023`

and enter the folder that has just been created

`cd EP-POO2023`

## Compile

Simply run it:

`g++ src/*.cpp -o program_name`

Change `program_name` to any name you like.

Or:

`make`

The binary will be in `build/main`

## Run

To run, simply run the following:

`./program_name`

# Marks or Grades or Whatever
The project is divided into two parts: EP-1 and EP-2.  

The final grades for the project will be updated throughout the semester:  

EP-1 -> [??]

EP-2 -> [??]

# Some notes

Unfortunately, the project has to be in this format (All files in src folder). This was due to requests from the teachers, believe me, it bothers more than it seems
